# Catppuccin Mocha for Directory Opus 13
A very simple Catppuccin Mocha theme for Directory Opus 13.

## Installation
1. Download the .dlt file.
2. Open Settings - Lister Themes.
3. Click "Import" and select the downloaded file.

## Notes
Yes, I am aware that many aspects are not themed or coloured correctly. Maybe one day...
